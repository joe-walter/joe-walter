# Joe Walter
Hai i am joe walter i have been staying at home after working for a long time in The field of programming and wanted to do something other than waiting for some event to happen in my life so i started a repository on github and now i want to do some projects that felt interesting to me. If you want to help out or just chat email me  here : [Joe Walter - Disroot.org](mailto:jwr0x7b7@disroot.org)
I am not an expert in the field of programming as i have spend my life just doing certain things like maintaining code but i still wish to challenge myself by building my projects out.
